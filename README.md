Convert opus files to mp3 with ffmpeg

Hello, this is my little Script to Convert all Opus Files in the Music Folder to mp3 through the ffmpeg Codec.
Since ffmpeg is almost as default installed in Linux Distributions, it will mostly work.
If needed you can install ffmpeg and use then the script.

Maybe you need to make the .sh file executeable with

"sudo chmod +x opustomp3.sh"

You can execute this File as a normal User, just type ./opustomp3.sh and let the magic happen.

Note: You can change the Directory or Fileformat by editing the file.
if you want to convert mp4 to mp3 you have to change *.opus to *.mp4 and %opus/mp3 to %mp4/mp3!

Thank you and don't forget: make Life easy! :)
