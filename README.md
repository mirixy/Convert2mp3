# Opus2mp3
This began as a opus 2 mp3 project and is now a fully functional ffmpeg converter.

WARNING: You must have python and ffmpeg!

Convert files to mp3 with ffmpeg

Hello, this is my little Python Script that converts your Media Files to mp3.
It works with the ffmpeg Codec. Since it is almost standard in Linux Systems, it will work out of the Box.

If ffmpeg isn't installed you can easily install it with your PackageManager.

NOTE: The Folder where this programm seeks your files is the "Music" Folder in your Home directory.
If your System-Language is German, your Folder might be "Musik" , so in Order to use this program, you have to change the converter.py file.
Obviously you have to change "Music" with your destination.

Maybe i will rewrite the Code, that you can choose your destination Folder. I could do a seperate Version to do so.

You might ask what format you can convert. Please visit the ffmpeg wiki for informations: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Video-and-Audio-file-format-conversion

Examples: opus ogg mp4 flac

How does this program work?

Just type in your terminal : ./converter.py
Then it will ask you which format do you want to convert.
After your input, the magic begins.

Thank you and don't forget: make Life easy! :)
